Software development as a discipline pushes businesses ahead. Every business is
getting online now, with presence in various forms, whether it's a simple website
, e-commerce website or a mobile application. Businesses that do not have an
online presence are basically nonexistent businesses. While every business and
individual is pushing and improving his online business, we as software
developers have deadlines and boundaries that we have to manage and move between.

Given the constraints on the business level, it is very common in programming 
land to see bad decisions made for multiple reasons. It can be plain ignorance,
or just constraints that have to be rushed through. While there are many 
processes that try to solve these problems, still this is a very complex feat
that software developers struggle.

Bad code is almost always a side-effect. But, how do we know what bad or good
code is? Generally, if you ask a non-programming person, good code is code that
works. Which is totally fine, it's a solid point. But, on the technical side,
what is good code? I would say one thing - easy to maintain.
