My name is Ilija Eftimov and I am a software engineer. I recently moved to live
and work in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fteem),
[Github](https://github.com/fteem) and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ieftimov). I also use some other social
networks, but I don't think that you will find anything interesting there. So,
yeah, forget I said anything.

I work for [Catawiki](http://catawiki.com) as a backend developer, building
APIs, reviewing code, hunting bugs and slaying dragons.

Before that, I spent three years as a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer,
working for <a target='_blank' href='http://siyelo.com'>Siyelo</a>.

I grew up and lived in
[Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Macedonia), where I
graduated from university and started my career as a software engineer.

In my spare time, I am the author of couple of tiny Ruby gems, I used to be
one of the organizers of Rails Girls in Macedonia and a part-time programming
tutor.

If you want to get in touch, you can ping me via
<a href="mailto:ileeftimov+blog@gmail.com">email</a>. Or, Twitter.
